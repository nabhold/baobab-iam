# Dockerfile – multi‑stage build for Keycloak with Baobab configuration
#
# The upstream quay.io/keycloak/keycloak final-stage image is built on
# ubi9-micro, which intentionally has no package manager (no dnf/microdnf).
# bootstrap.sh (executed inside the running container) needs jq (to read
# clientId / merge a dev-only secret from the client JSON files) — it does
# NOT need curl; the readiness wait loop uses kcadm.sh's own bundled Java
# HTTP client instead (see bootstrap.sh). Per Red Hat's documented pattern
# for adding packages to a micro image, jq is resolved in a throwaway ubi9
# stage and its installed files copied into the final image — this avoids
# pulling a package manager, or its transitive attack surface, into the
# shipped image itself.
#
# curl was deliberately NOT added here: an earlier version of this
# Dockerfile installed it alongside jq, and Trivy flagged the ubi9-provided
# curl/libcurl package for 3 HIGH-severity CVEs with no fixed version yet
# available upstream (CVE-2026-11352, CVE-2026-11586, CVE-2026-8925).
# Nothing in this image actually needs curl, so the fix was to drop it
# rather than accept the exposure.

# The upstream image already switches to its non-root runtime user (see
# the final stage's own USER 1000 below), which this build stage inherits.
# COPY always creates root-owned files regardless of the current USER, so
# the chmod below would fail as a non-root, non-owning user ("Operation
# not permitted"). This stage is discarded after the build (multi-stage),
# so building it as root has no effect on the shipped runtime image, which
# still ends with USER 1000.

# `db` is a build-time option in Keycloak: an `--optimized` runtime start
# (see the final stage's CMD) skips re-augmentation and so ignores any
# `KC_DB` set only at runtime (docker-compose.yml's own `KC_DB: postgres`
# is therefore not enough by itself) — it must already be baked into this
# build. Without this, the container never reaches a running state: it
# silently keeps whatever `db` this build step defaulted to and never
# becomes healthy, which is what happened before this was added (the
# integration-test job's Keycloak container ran for 5 minutes without
# ever reaching /health/ready). Connection details (db-url/username/
# password) remain correctly runtime-only, set in docker-compose.yml.
