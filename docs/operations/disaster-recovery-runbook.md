# IAM Disaster Recovery Runbook

**Governing ADR:** `ADR-0018 — IAM Availability, Backup, Recovery and Disaster Resilience` §90-93, §215
**Owner of this document:** `nabhold/baobab-iam` (per §215's ownership table, jointly with `nabhold/infrastructure`)

This runbook exists because ADR-0018 §90 requires one ("`nabhold/baobab-iam` and/or
`nabhold/infrastructure` SHALL maintain a version-controlled DR runbook") and none
existed before Gate IAM-14. It documents the 17-step recovery sequence from §91
against what this repository actually owns today, not an aspirational full
recovery procedure — steps this repository does not own are marked as such and
point to `nabhold/infrastructure` rather than describing infrastructure this
repository has no visibility into.

Per §89, only authorized operations/security roles SHALL initiate production IAM
disaster recovery — this document assumes that decision has already been made
(§88, "DR Authority" / "Disaster Declaration") by the time anyone is executing it.

Per §92-93, **a successful Keycloak startup after restore is not the same as
"safe to serve production."** Every step below runs before traffic reopens.

## Recovery sequence

| # | Step (ADR-0018 §91) | Owner | What `baobab-iam` actually provides |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Contain incident | Operations/Security | Not this repo. |
| 2 | Determine trusted recovery point | Infrastructure + Security | Not this repo — backup/PITR tooling is `nabhold/infrastructure`-owned (§215). |
| 3 | Restore infrastructure dependencies | Infrastructure | Not this repo. |
| 4 | Restore PostgreSQL | Infrastructure | Not this repo — database HA/backup/PITR is `nabhold/infrastructure`-owned (§215). |
| 5 | Restore cryptographic/secrets dependencies | Infrastructure | Not this repo — secret management is `nabhold/infrastructure`-owned (§215). |
| 6 | Deploy pinned Keycloak | `baobab-iam` + Infrastructure | This repo's `Dockerfile` (`FROM quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.7.3`) and `upstream.lock.yaml` are the pin's source of truth. **Known gap:** `upstream.lock.yaml`'s image digest is still an unresolved placeholder (R-1, `docs/governance/gate-iam-0-discovery.md`) — see [Gate IAM-14 scope](../governance/gate-iam-14-availability-dr-scope.md). |
| 7 | Validate database/schema | Infrastructure | Not this repo. |
| 8 | Validate realm/client configuration | **`baobab-iam`** | `make bootstrap` re-applies `config/realm/baobab-realm.json` and `config/clients/*.json`/`config/scopes/*.json` idempotently (ADR-0002's declarative-config model) — re-running it after restore is how realm/client drift gets corrected. |
| 9 | Validate signing/JWKS | **`baobab-iam`** + Infrastructure | `tests/integration/run.sh` §2-3 (OIDC discovery + JWKS retrieval) prove the restored realm is issuing discoverable, verifiable tokens. Key material itself is Infrastructure-owned secrets/PKI. |
| 10 | Apply post-backup security changes | `baobab-cp` + `baobab-iam` | ADR-0018 §96-100's "security journal" (identities/credentials/sessions revoked *after* the restored backup's point-in-time) is not implemented anywhere in this session's scope yet — see [Gate IAM-14 scope](../governance/gate-iam-14-availability-dr-scope.md) §4. Until it exists, this step is manual: whoever declares the incident must independently know what was revoked between the backup and the disaster, and re-apply those revocations via the Admin API before reopening traffic. |
| 11 | Reconcile revocations | `baobab-cp` + `baobab-iam` | Same gap as step 10 — no automated reconciliation exists. `tests/integration/run.sh` §16 proves *how* to revoke (disable identity, revoke sessions) once the list of what to revoke is known. |
| 12 | Validate CP integration | `baobab-cp` | Not this repo's test suite — `baobab-cp` validates its own token acceptance and canonical-identity resolution against the restored realm. |
| 13 | Validate engine authentication | `baobab-trade`, `baobab-erp`, `baobab-cms`, `baobab-pulse` | Not this repo's test suite. |
| 14 | Run security smoke tests | **`baobab-iam`** | `BOOTSTRAP_WORKLOAD_CLIENT_SECRET=... ./tests/integration/run.sh` — see §18 below for exactly which of ADR-0018 §165's required checks this suite covers today. |
| 15 | Reopen traffic gradually | Infrastructure | Not this repo. |
| 16 | Monitor | Infrastructure + Security | Not this repo. |
| 17 | Complete incident review | Operations/Security | Not this repo. |

## What `baobab-iam`'s own recovery procedure is (steps 6, 8, 9, 14)

1. Deploy the image pinned by this repository's `Dockerfile` and `upstream.lock.yaml`
   (step 6) once Infrastructure confirms PostgreSQL and secrets are restored and
   reachable (steps 2-5).
2. Run `make bootstrap` against the restored, empty-or-partial realm. Bootstrap is
   idempotent (ADR-0002) — it is safe to run against a realm that already has some
   or all of its configuration, since it reconciles to the checked-in JSON rather
   than assuming a clean slate.
3. Run `BOOTSTRAP_WORKLOAD_CLIENT_SECRET=<value> ./tests/integration/run.sh`
   against the restored instance (steps 9, 14). A clean pass proves discovery,
   JWKS, workload authentication, PKCE enforcement, workforce/role separation,
   MFA flow structure, and the identity-lifecycle kill switch all work on the
   restored instance — not just that Keycloak started.
4. Before declaring `baobab-iam` itself ready for step 12 (CP integration
   validation) to proceed, manually confirm (per step 10-11's known gap) that any
   identity, credential, session, or role revoked between the backup's point in
   time and the disaster has been re-applied. ADR-0018 §94-95's binding invariant
   is that **a restore SHALL NOT return previously revoked identity authority to
   service** — this is a manual verification today, not an automated one; see
   [Gate IAM-14 scope](../governance/gate-iam-14-availability-dr-scope.md) §4 for
   why automating it (a "post-backup security journal") was deferred rather than
   built in this gate.

## DR exercises (ADR-0018 §119-123)

This repository does not yet run periodic DR exercises (§119 — that is Platform
Operations + Security's responsibility per §215). When one is run, ADR-0018 §121's
"Revocation Resurrection Test" is the mandatory minimum:

```text
1. create identity
2. create backup
3. revoke identity/credential
4. restore backup
5. reconcile
6. prove revoked access remains denied
```

`tests/integration/run.sh` §16 already proves step 6's mechanics in isolation
(disable an identity, confirm a new authentication attempt is denied) without a
real backup/restore cycle around it — a real exercise should wrap that same
assertion around an actual Infrastructure-driven backup and restore, once that
tooling exists to test against.
