# Baobab IAM (`baobab-iam`)

> **Baobab IAM** is the central authentication and identity provider for the Baobab platform. It implements **who** you are, while the Control Plane (`baobab-cp`) determines **where** and **what** you are entitled to, and domain engines enforce business authorization.

## Status

- **Architecture:** [ADR-0001 through ADR-0018](./docs/adr/README.md)
- **Implementation:** All sixteen gates (IAM-0 through IAM-16) have had at least a phase 1
  pass; Gate IAM-2 (Keycloak foundation) hardening itself remains open — see
  [Gate IAM-0 discovery](./docs/governance/gate-iam-0-discovery.md) for the verified
  implementation state and open risks (notably R-1: the pinned Keycloak image digest in
  `upstream.lock.yaml` is still a placeholder pending registry access). Gate IAM-3's
  Control Plane identity spine (`CanonicalIdentity`/`ExternalIdentity`, in `baobab-cp`) and
  Gate IAM-4 (workload identity, ADR-0007) are **complete** — see
  [Gate IAM-3 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-3-canonical-identity-scope.md) and
  [Gate IAM-4 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-4-workload-identity-scope.md). Gate IAM-5
  (workforce SSO, ADR-0009) phase 1 (distinct workforce admin clients, a starter role
  namespace, a real `baobab-cp` admin-authorization defect fixed) and phase 2a
  (`baobab-trade` OIDC wiring, `nabhold/baobab-trade#70`) are complete. Phase 2b
  (`baobab-cms` OIDC wiring) is explicitly deferred to its own phase — see
  [Gate IAM-5 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-5-workforce-sso-scope.md) §5.1. Gate IAM-6
  (Zuribeans B2B, ADR-0010) phase 1 (Keycloak Organizations enabled, verified end-to-end
  against a real Keycloak instance) is complete — see
  [Gate IAM-6 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-6-zuribeans-b2b-scope.md) for phases 2+
  (`baobab-cp` canonical-entity wiring, cross-buyer isolation against real tokens). Gate
  IAM-7 (Thamani B2C, ADR-0011) is **scoped, not yet implemented** — discovery found two
  genuine architectural forks (where the customer OIDC redirect terminates; how a guest
  order's claim proof is delivered) that need their own decisions before code — see
  [Gate IAM-7 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-7-thamani-b2c-scope.md) §3. Gate IAM-8
  (Supplier Identity, ADR-0012) is **scoped, not yet implemented** — discovery found no
  repository anywhere owns "supplier domain" logic yet (a bigger blocker than Gate IAM-7's
  forks), so implementation is deferred pending that ownership decision — see
  [Gate IAM-8 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-8-supplier-identity-scope.md) §3. Gate
  IAM-9 (Medusa Integration, ADR-0013) found most of its scope already satisfied by Gate
  IAM-5's admin OIDC wiring, plus one real gap fixed — `authMethodsPerActor` was unset,
  making the admin `oidc` provider also implicitly reachable by the customer actor
  (`nabhold/baobab-trade#71`) — see
  [Gate IAM-9 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-9-medusa-integration-scope.md). Gate IAM-10
  (ERP Integration, ADR-0014) found iDempiere 13 ships a real, pluggable, built-in OIDC
  mechanism (`org.idempiere.ui.sso.oidc`) — a workforce SSO client (`baobab-erp-admin`) is
  provisioned for it, and `baobab-erp`'s previously-unauthenticated
  `/context/resolve*`/`/mapping/resolve*` endpoints now validate workload tokens. Ships
  against one explicit, documented deviation from ADR-0014 §9 (the stock plugin matches by
  email/username, not `issuer+subject`) — see
  [Gate IAM-10 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-10-erp-integration-scope.md) §2. Gate
  IAM-11 (Credential Security/MFA/Passkeys, ADR-0015) phase 1 fixes a real password-policy
  violation (§11-14: was requiring composition rules the ADR explicitly prohibits) and
  makes MFA mandatory for every existing workforce admin role via a role-driven
  conditional-OTP browser flow, verified structurally against a real Keycloak instance —
  see [Gate IAM-11 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-11-credential-security-scope.md) §4
  for this ADR's large remaining scope (passkeys as an MFA alternative, step-up for
  specific high-risk actions, recovery hardening, break-glass, and more). Gate IAM-12
  (Identity Lifecycle/Revocation/Deprovisioning, ADR-0016) phase 1 closed a real
  administrative-audit gap (`adminEventsEnabled` was never set) and proved the IAM-side
  "kill switch" — disable identity + revoke sessions — end-to-end against a real Keycloak
  instance; most of this 213-section ADR is `baobab-cp`/domain-engine territory, not
  `baobab-iam`'s — see
  [Gate IAM-12 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-12-identity-lifecycle-scope.md) §1, §5. Gate
  IAM-13 (Audit/Observability, ADR-0017) phase 1 proved — against a real Keycloak instance,
  not by trusting upstream claims — that Gate IAM-12's admin-event logging actually redacts
  secrets (a plaintext-password marker never appears in the resulting audit record) and that
  credential revocation is captured in the audit trail; most of this 205-section ADR is
  `baobab-cp`/domain-engine/infrastructure territory — see
  [Gate IAM-13 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-13-audit-observability-scope.md) §1, §4. Gate
  IAM-14 (Availability/Backup/DR, ADR-0018) phase 1 adds this repo's first
  [DR runbook](./docs/operations/disaster-recovery-runbook.md), verifies the running
  Keycloak instance's version actually matches `upstream.lock.yaml`'s pin (not just that the
  file claims one), and closes a real PKCE coverage gap (`baobab-control-plane-admin` was
  never checked by the old hardcoded client list); R-1 (image digest) is re-confirmed still
  blocked on `quay.io` egress, and a new, unrelated defect (`loginTheme`/`accountTheme:
  "baobab"` references a theme that was never built) was found and deliberately left open —
  see [Gate IAM-14 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-14-availability-dr-scope.md) §5, §7. Gate
  IAM-15 (Multi-Region Readiness) required no `baobab-iam` code changes — discovery found
  `baobab-cp` already implements the region/market/`CapabilityBinding`/`EngineInstance` model
  this gate's checklist describes (including real residency-mismatch enforcement in its
  topology resolver), the IAM/CP boundary needs no region claim, and this repo's current
  single-global-realm architecture is the correct Phase A per the Consolidated Spec's own
  multi-region evolution model. One item does NOT get a clean bill of health: the "revoked
  account survives DR restore" row from the spec's Multi-Region Test Matrix is real but not
  yet proven end-to-end (no actual backup/restore/reconciliation exercise exists) — see
  [Gate IAM-15 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-15-multi-region-readiness-scope.md) §5, §7.
  Gate IAM-16 (Production Hardening) — the final gate in the program — validated all twelve
  checklist items against real evidence rather than assuming them satisfied: closed two real
  gaps (SBOM generation added to CI; a new
  [security incident-response runbook](./docs/operations/security-incident-runbook.md) for
  compromised credentials/clients, distinct from the DR runbook), gave a reasoned (not just
  deferred) answer on login-storm risk against this realm's actual brute-force configuration,
  and reported cross-tenant isolation accurately as partial (workload isolation proven;
  buyer/Organization cross-isolation still Gate IAM-6 phase 2+) rather than repeating an
  overclaim — see
  [Gate IAM-16 scope](./docs/governance/gate-iam-16-production-hardening-scope.md).
- **Next:** All sixteen numbered gates (IAM-0 through IAM-16) have now had at least a phase 1
  pass. What remains is every gate's own deferred work, none of it resolved by reaching
  IAM-16: Gate IAM-2 (environment separation, MFA/Organizations baseline), Gate IAM-5's
  remaining phases (`baobab-cms` OIDC wiring, `baobab-cp` role-aware admin authorization),
  Gate IAM-6's remaining phases (including cross-buyer isolation testing), the shared Gate
  IAM-7/IAM-9 customer-OIDC-termination decision, Gate IAM-8's supplier-domain ownership
  decision, Gate IAM-10's remaining phases (closing its ADR-0014 §9 deviation,
  AD_User/Role/Client/Org provisioning), Gate IAM-11's remaining phases, Gate IAM-12's open
  architectural fork (custom Keycloak event-listener SPI vs. `baobab-cp` polling the native
  Admin Events API), Gate IAM-13's deferred retention-policy decision, Gate IAM-14's real
  remaining gaps (the missing `baobab` theme, a post-backup security journal, and R-1), Gate
  IAM-15's deferred multi-region phases B-D and its unproven DR-restore test-matrix row, and
  Gate IAM-16's own open items (a penetration test, a real DR/load-testing exercise, a
  bulk-revocation tool, an actually-run incident-response drill).

## What this repository is

`baobab-iam` runs **Keycloak** as the authentication runtime. It owns:

- Authentication (OIDC, OAuth, MFA, passkeys)
- Credential management
- Authentication sessions
- Account recovery
- Identity federation
- Workload client credentials

It does **not** own:

- Tenant lifecycle (that is `baobab-cp`)
- Business authorization (that is domain engines)
- Commerce or ERP data
